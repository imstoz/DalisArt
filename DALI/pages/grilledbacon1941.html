                            (1941)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Dalí Theatre and Museum, Figueres, Spain.

            <p>Initially the image seems bizarre. A caricature of Dali's own face, complete with upturned moustache,
                appears on a plinth, like a trophy or bust. The plinth bears the name of the name of the painting and
                has a single piece of fried bacon beside it. Dali's eye's are missing, only the sockets are visible and
                have ants crawling around them. Sections of the bronze, mask-like face are propped up with crutches of
                various sizes supporting the soft face as it appears to slide off the plinth. Dali manages to create a
                wonderful illusion of liquidity in this work, so that the face appears to be melting and sliding.

            <p>In this piece, it seems that Dali knew his use of crutches was popular, so simply added more. However
                they are clearly providing "support". The ants were often used as a symbol of decay, but in this image
                they are attracted to the food sources. Dali chose to offer his "outer self" or skin in this painting
                and imagined it like food, even bacon. Dali described this as painting "the glove" instead of "the
                soul". Dali used the words "anti-psychological" to describe this particular self portrait.</p>
