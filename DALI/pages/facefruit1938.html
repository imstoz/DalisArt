                            (1938)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dal√≠. It is currently housed at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut

            <p>The art brings out confusing images that may take time for one to understand its contents. It is more of
                a puzzle image. Dali used different
                colors of painting together with oil to paint this art on a piece of canvas of dimensions 1.15 m and
                1.44 m. The outlook of this painting contains
                an image of a dish full of fruits, an illusion of a face and an image of a dog on a beach. The face
                image is a combination of a face with a bowl as
                the forehead and the nose is made from the stem of the bowl while the face has an eye that appears like
                a shell which makes the beach portrait visible.

        <div class="para2">
            <p>Despite the image being on a beach, there are other features on the background such as clouds on a
                mountain at the furthest end of the portrait while
                just beneath the dog's neck there is a presentation of a traditional home compound and some images of a
                naked adult standing at the entrance of a building
                and a small child reaching on something from a higher height. There is also an image of a railway or a
                bridge from the collar of the dog which goes into the sea.
                This image tries to bring out some hidden sense in the combination of all these images. The art portrait
                is a presentation of color combination that gives the
                image a bright and attractive outlook.</p>
