            <p>Shortly after the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Salvador Dali painted the work known as
                Autumnal Cannibalism. It is an oil on canvass painting that measures 65cm by 65cm. Edward James
                purchased the picture from the artist in 1936. He later sold it to the Tate Museum in 1975 where
                it continues to remain. Dali's Autumnal Cannibalism presents a thought-provoking view of the horror
                and destruction of war. Critics claim that the painting also shows the consuming nature of sexual
                relationships. The painting appears almost tranquil like suggesting that Dali's view of the conflict
                was almost indifferent. Unlike other Surrealists, Dali did not take sides in the war. The background
                s of a rocky landscape set against a Catalonian beach. In the centre is a bloody lake and in the
                distance a single white house. On the beach is a chest of drawers. Sitting on top of it are the top
                halves of a male and female figure.

            <p>They appear locked in a cannibalistic embrace. One hand is holding a fork while another is holding a
                polished
                knife. Both are eating into each other. Mixed in with the figures in the picture are other signs and
                symbols.
                For example, there are bits of meat placed on the chest of drawers and figures. As well as symbolising
                death,
                it can also refer to the passing nature of life and human's animal nature. Balanced on the head of one
                of the
                figures is an apple. For Dali, this was a way of showing the struggle between father and son. The peeled
                apple
                below it symbolises the death of the son. With his mad expression and famous moustache, Dali’s legacy
                has made
                him a cultural icon for surrealism. As a result, modern surrealists view Dali as an important source of
                inspiration.</p>
