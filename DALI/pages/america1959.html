                            Columbus (1959)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg,
                        Florida.</p></a>

            <p>The painting, depicting the Genoise explorer’s discovery of the New World, was commissioned by George
                Huntingford Hartford II and displayed at the Museum Gallery of Modern Art in Manhattan. The museum,
                situated in the 2 Columbus Circle building, closed in 1969 and the painting was sold at a later date to
                Reynolds and Eleanor Morse who displayed it at the Salvador Dalí Museum in Florida. A wooden sailing
                ship, located at the bottom-centre of the painting and visible from the stern-side, represents one of
                the three ships that made the first transatlantic expedition in 1492. It is likely that Santa Maria, the
                carrack in which Columbus sailed during his first journey across the Atlantic, is the ship that is
                featured in the painting but the caravels Pinta and Niña are also possible contenders. The ship has
                rounded bilges and a raised aftercastle while each of the two square sails, unfurled and hanging from
                their yards, is emblazoned with a cross.

            <p>The explorer, although in his forties at the time in which he first arrived at the Caribbean island of
                Hispaniola, is depicted as an adolescent boy on the left-hand side of the painting and his youthfulness
                could signify his discovery of a New World on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Dalí, inspired by
                Roman Catholic mysticism and a devotion to his native land of Spain, creates a dreamlike scene in which
                both the introduction of Christianity to the Americas and the spread of Spanish civilisation to the New
                World are celebrated. The unification of Spain, brought about by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella,
                combined the Mediterranean empire of the Catalans with the Atlantic empire of the Castilians. Dalí was
                of the opinion that Columbus, an an Italian in the service of the Crowns of Aragon and Castile, was born
                in Catalonia and this belief is embodied in the form of a Catalan flag that resides on the right-hand
                side of the painting. A female figure, shrouded in white robes and with a halo around her head, hovers
                in front of the banner that Columbus grasps in his left hand.</p>
