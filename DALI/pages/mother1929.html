            <p>Through the left hole, a distant rock structure is set in stark color contrasts with the white and brown
                sky and land. The structure features the torso of a woman. On the extreme top-right, a smaller
                protrusion
                comes out of the larger shape, seemingly resembling the head of an animal. The base of the large
                structure
                is shaped like the curved forms of fin de siècle architecture and furniture, with intricate and elegant
                designs encrusted throughout. The base also has molluscs, which strengthens the allusions to Cape Creus.
