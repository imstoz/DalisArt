                            New Man (1943)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St Petersburg,
                        Florida</p></a>

            <p>With the region being either Africa or South America. This is because from the painting we can see a man
                coming out of an egg. The walls of the egg has two visible ccontinents Africa and South America hence
                the conclusion that the environment might be Africa or South America. From the painting, we are also
                able to see that the region might be experiencing drought or famine. This is so since the two characters
                available in the painting are skinny and look starved. From the painting, you're able to see the
                character thought to be the mom showing the child the egg. As the man tries to hatch out of it, the mum
                attempts to explain to the child the process of birth.

            <p>We can say that from the egg is well taken care of since it's on a mat and is protected from the Sun
                using a shade. We can conclude that the community valued Birth and regarded it as something special. The
                Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of the New Man by Salvador Dali is well detailed to the point
                that; the painter shows us a shadow of the two characters. The painter is also able to blend in colors
                appropriately. He has a good choice of colours and knows what to mix with what. This colour choice
                describes the environment, thus allowing us to make several conclusions about the atmosphere of the
                painting. The painting portrays the painter as an individual who is well informed about geography since
                he can give an almost exact image of two continents.</p>
