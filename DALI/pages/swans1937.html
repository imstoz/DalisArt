                        a surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. The painting was one of many art pieces stolen by the
                        Nazis in France and Belgium between 1940 and 1944.</p></a>

            <p>It comes from what he termed his “Paranoic-critical” period. Inspired by Freud, Dali would
                induce a state of paranoia to allow his brain to create unseen links between objects. In Swans
                Reflecting Elephants, Dali uses double images to transfigure graceful swans into huge, land-locked
                animals. As in his earlier work, Metamorphosis of Narcissus, he uses water to reflect alternative
                realities.

            <p>Here, the trees of the Catalan landscape merge with the swans' reflections to create elephants in a
                technically
                brilliant painting. The swans are carried upon the elephants backs through the stark landscape whilst a
                lone
                figure blends into the background, his back to the scene</p>
