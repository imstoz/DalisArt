            <p>Elephants, along with melting clocks, are the two best known objects from Dali's Surrealist periods. Dali
                made use of elephants on several occasions, with their inclusion in this painting best known for their
                elongated limbs. Closer attention also reveals that the animals are carrying heavy obelisks on the
                backs, and these are
                believed to have been inspired by the work of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. This Italian had produced sculpture
                base in Rome where an elephant carrys an ancient obelisk.
