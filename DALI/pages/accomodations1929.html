                        surrealist oil painting and mixed media collage
                        on board by Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed in the Metropolitan
                        Museum of Art in New York City.</p></a>

            <p>Dali painted the picture after taking a walk with Gala, his 10-year-older lover, who
                was then the wife of artist Paul Éluard. The painting consists of seven lumpish white
                "pebbles", each symbolizing something that Dali believed lay ahead for him. These include
                "terrorizing" lions' heads (not very "accommodating" to the painter’s desires as the
                name of the art piece suggests), a toupee and a colony of ants which symbolize decay. Also
                in the painting are three figures on a platform and a number of vessels (one in the form of a woman’s
                head).</p>

            <p>While the painted work is an exposé of Dalí's deepest fears, it is also a trial of the use of early
                collage
                techniques. The heads of the lion were not painted but, rather, glued onto the canvas and are thought to
                have
                been cut out from an illustrated children's book. The pasted-on cutouts have a visual style that bears
                an
                indistinguishable resemblance to the painting's aesthetic. </p>
