                        painting by Salvador Dalí. The painting
                        currently resides at the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. This
                        work is on loan from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. A Reynolds Morse.</p></a>

            <p>This work of surrealistic art showcases a geometric figure with a tumescent red
                hand protruding from its head. The figure is composed of cones and triangles.
                Surrounding the structure are ghostly images of nude female figures and torsos
                superimposed on a blue, watery dreamscape. This piece was done upon Dalí's return
                from 9 months of military duty. It was during his military career that Dalí began
                experimenting with new subjects for his work. The Apparatus in the title refers
                to the geometric figure which is structured much like the human form. The figure
                has analogues of human arms, legs, an eye, and a head. The triangular being is
                propped up on what appears to be a cane, which was a leitmotif in Dalí's work
                representing the fragility of sleep.</p>

            <p>The hand atop the figure's head is a reference to Onanism, which was a common theme
                in his work at the time. This period of Dalí's career is referred to as the Freudian
                Period. This was during the Avant-Garde movement which was heavily weighted on the
                writings of Freud. The female images surrounding the geometric figure are
                representative of thoughts within the mind of the Apparatus. These images represent
                the delirious erotic thought processes of the artist, which was also a prevailing
                theme of his work. To the left of the geometric man is an image of a donkey on its hind legs. The donkey
                is being consumed by a horde of flies which are attacking its belly. This is indicative
                of the decomposition of the creature. On the right of the structure is a classically
                posed female, which is set in contrast to the geometric simplicity of the center image</p>
