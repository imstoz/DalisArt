            <p>The technique used in the first days of spring painting was surrealism. This technique
                is used to show how things can be if looked from a different perspective. In the first
                days of spring painting, it is about Dali's childhood and imagination. In the middle of
                the painting, there is a collage of Dali's childhood picture. Salvador Dali used oil
                and collage on a wood panel to make this creative painting. The use of collage on a
                painting is one of the most amazing skills of an artist. In the painting, the collage
                blends in with painting that it is hard to say what's real and what’s not. There are
                two collages used in the painting one is Dali's childhood picture, and the other one
                is the ship’s deck behind the two figures on the lower left of the painting. No one
                commissioned the first days of spring painting as this was Dali creation of his imagination.
                He wanted to show the art of imagination and dreaming and reflected it on the painting.</p>

            <p>The First Days of Spring painting are owned by the Salvador Dali museum in St. Petersburg Florida.
                The painting shows a clear image of a creative mind of Salvador Dali. Most of the images in the
                painting are believed to be in connection with Dali's childhood. The First Days of Spring painting
                were inspired by the work of Sigmund Freud the interpretation of dreams. Sigmund feud stated that
                the source of fear and desire could be found in people’s childhood experience. This painting
                tries to depict the awakening of Deli at a young age. The painting shows a lot of stories that
                can be found in a person’s imagination. Additionally, the painting shows that your childhood experience
                can shape your future.</p>
