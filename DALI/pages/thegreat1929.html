                        painting by Salvador Dalí executed during the surrealist epoch,
                        and is currently displayed at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid. </a></p>

            <p>The center of the painting has a distorted human face in profile
                looking downwards, based on the shape of a natural rock formation
                at Cap de Creus along the sea-shore of Catalonia. A similar profile
                is seen in Dalí’s more famous painting of two years later, T
                he Persistence of Memory. A nude female figure (resembling Dalí’s
                then new muse, Gala) rises from the back of the head; this may be
                the masturbatory fantasy suggested by the title.</p>

        <div class="para2">
            <p>The woman’s mouth is near a thinly clad male crotch,
                a suggestion that fellatio may take place. The male
                figure seen only from the waist down has bleeding fresh
                cuts on his knees. Below the central profile head, on its
                mouth, is a grasshopper, an insect Dali referred to
                several times in his writings. A swarm of ants (a popular
                motif representing sexual anxiety in Dalí’s work) gather
                on the grasshopper’s abdomen, as well as on the prone face.
                In the landscape below, three other figures are arranged,
                along with an egg (commonly used as a symbol of fertility)
                and sparse other features. Two of the characters in the
                landscape are arranged in such a way as to cast a long
                single shadow, while the other character is seen hurriedly
                walking into the distance on the peripheries of the canvas.
                On the back of the central head figure, a formation of two
                rocks and a potted dry plant can be seen, the pot of the
                plant placed over the bottom rock while balancing the other
                rock on top of it in an unrealistic way. This part is thought
                to represent the escape-of-reality idea found in many of Dalí’s
                other artworks.</p>
