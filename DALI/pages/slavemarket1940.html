                            Voltaire (1940)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg,

            <p>The painting features slave trade which had been common since the beginning of time. Though blurry and
                unclear you can see the trader, the market and the slaves. The environment of the painting is
                uncivilized. This is because most of the characters in the picture are fully nude or half nude. This
                enables us to differentiate between the traders, the slaves, and buyers. The background of the painting
                can tell us that the paint was done in a yet developing civilization that had significant control over
                slave trade.

            <p>The art displays total inhumanity that was being practiced back in the days. The name of the painting
                also describes to us time and when the piece of art was painted. Though sad and inhumane, the painting
                offers a lot to the audience. It not only describes the artist but also brings in the sense of
                entertainment and enjoyment of art. The painting leaves most individuals who see it gaped. This is
                because the artist Is able to bring in emotions in the painting. When you have a
                look at the painting, you can imagine yourself to be one or all of the three characters namely the
                trader, the slave and the as the buyer.</p>
