                        Surrealist object, created by Salvador Dalí
                        for the English poet Edward James (1907–1984), a leading collector of surrealist art. In his
                        book
                        The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, Dalí wrote teasingly of his demand to know why, when he asked
                        for a
                        grilled lobster in a restaurant, he was never presented with a boiled telephone. </p></a>

            <p>This is a classic example of a Surrealist object, made from the conjunction of items not normally
                associated with each other, resulting in something both playful and menacing. Dalí believed that
                such objects could reveal the secret desires of the unconscious. Lobsters and telephones had strong
                sexual connotations for Dalí. The telephone appears in certain paintings of the late 1930s such as
                Mountain Lake (Tate), and the lobster appears in drawings and designs, usually associated with erotic
                pleasure and pain. For the 1939 New York World's Fair, Dalí created a multi-media experience entitled
                Dream of Venus, which consisted in part of dressing live nude models in "costumes" made of fresh
                seafood, an event photographed by Horst P. Horst and George Platt Lynes. A lobster was used by the
                artist to cover the female sexual organs of his models. Dalí often drew a close analogy between food
                and sex. In Lobster Telephone, the crustacean's tail, where its sexual parts are located, is placed
                directly over the mouthpiece.

            <p>Dalí produced five examples of the color version of his telephone. One was on display at the Dalí
                Universe
                in London; a second can be found at the Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt; another is owned by the
                Edward James Foundation; a fourth is at the National Gallery of Australia; and the fifth example is in
                the
                collection of Tate Modern, London. Dalí also produced an off-white version of his telephone. Of the six
                known
                examples, one is owned by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts; another by the Salvador Dalí Museum in
                St. Petersburg, Florida. A third example is held at Centro Cultural de Belém, in Portugal, and is owned
                by the
                art collector Joe Berardo. Another example can be viewed at the Johannesburg Art Gallery in
                Johannesburg, South Africa.
                Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen also has a phone in their collection in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In
                March 2018, Arts
                minister Michael Ellis placed a temporary export ban on an off-white Lobster Telephone after it was sold
                by the Edward James Foundation; to allow British collections or collectors to match the purchase price
                of £853,047.
                The telephone was successfully acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland in December 2018 and is
                displayed at the
                Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.</p>
