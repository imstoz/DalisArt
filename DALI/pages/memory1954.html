                            Memory (1953)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg,
                        Florida.</p></a>

            <p>The painting is a response to another painting of Dali's
                called <a href="/pages/memory1931.html">Persistence of Memory (1931)</a>. Both paintings have similar
                main features but the second painting
                shows the original in a state of disintegration, as stated in the title.
                Painted over 20 years apart, the second painting clearly reflects a different society and a different
                mind-frame of Dali. The original painting is seen as representing time as fluid rather than rigid
                through the melting watches, a characteristic symbol of Dali's. In the new painting, the watches are
                featured again but the significance of the painting has changed
                drastically. The original landscape has become flooded and although it seems relatively calm above the
                surface, there is a lot of activity going on below.

            <p>
                The activity going on below the surface is a reflection of some of the new ideas Dali learned throughout
                the surrealism movement as well as changes to society as a result of global war.
                The bricks along the bottom are said to represent atoms, which is something new that was learned by Dali
                and all of society through the study and quantum mechanics. The other elements, like the olive tree
                breaking apart and the cylindrical shapes are related and more bleak.
                The olive tree is a symbol of peace, which is evidently being broken in relation to the shapes which
                represent atomic missiles.
                At the time of this painting, the Cold War would have been going on, which is known for the fear of
                atomic bombs possibly causing the end of the world or the destruction of society.
                The painting also features the melting clocks, as mentioned above. Overall, this painting is understood
                as showing Dali's loss of interest in surrealism because it is the breaking down of his most famous
                work, Persistence of Memory, created at the height of the movement.
                Despite Dali's breaking away from surrealism with this painting, he will forever be associated with it
                due to his striking and iconic paintings.</p>
