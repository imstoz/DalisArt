            <p>Salvador Dali dedicated this painting to Jean Louis, a French painter of the 19th century who was
                well-known for his depictions of the battle scenes. According to Dali, the painting was his most
                ambitious artwork due solely to the dedication. The painting is currently owned by Paul Ricard
                Foundation, which is a private art collection centre in France. Tina Fishing depicts gentlemen acting
                violently toward Fish. It shows long golden daggers stabbing the aquatic creatures and the once blue
                waters turning to blood red. To Salvador, the gentlemen and the fish-killing in this painting personify
                the universe. The Tuna Fishing painting represents the combination of various art forms that Salvador
                Dali experimented within his early forty years as an artist. Majorly it is considered as part of the
                great Surrealism movement period. It also includes various styles such as Op and Pop Art, Action
                Painting, Tachisme, Psychedelic, and Pointillism.

            <p>In this painting, Salvador deliberately utilized the style and images of different artistic currents that
                he had studied before. The gentleman in the foreground of this art was depicted in popular styles in the
                1960s, and the antique sculpture inspired the image on the left-hand side. Salvador Dali spent two full
                summers, 1966 and 1967 to paint the Tuna Fishing. The artwork is full of the Dionysian figures, and the
                images were a kind of testament which represents the fruit of the 40 years of the devoted search for the
                means of visual expression. In the painting, he combined all the styles and techniques he had worked on
                including geometrical abstraction, tachism and refined Pompierism. Tuna Fishing proved significant as
                his 1930’s soft watch painting, the Persistence of Memory. The unique photographic quality of the Tuna
                Fishing painting is a tribute to Salvador’s skills and also to his modernity in utilizing projectors to
                place images directly on the readily available canvas. In this painting, the images range from cinema to
                Hellenistic Sculpture and mass slaughter of the fish is depicted as a bloodbath that might as well be a
                gladiatorial scene.</p>
