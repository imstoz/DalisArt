                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Dalí Theatre and Museum, Figueres.</p>

        <div class="para1">
            <p> This was Salvador Dali's last oil painting and is a representation of Dali’s understanding of
                mathematical
                theory based on the thinking of the Rene Thom.
                Thom, a highly respected French mathematician and Fields Medal winner proposed a catastrophe theory
                that, according to Dali, was “the most beautiful aesthetic theory in the world”.
                Thom’s theory suggests that in four-dimensional space there are seven equilibrium surfaces: swallowtail,
                butterfly, fold, cusp, elliptic umbilic, parabolic umbilic and hyperbolic umbilic, and Dali, perhaps
                because of his admiration for Thom’s work, undertook the not-inconsiderable challenge of successfully
                representing this relatively intangible four-dimensional theory on a two-dimensional canvas.

            <p>The shape of the swallow’s tail at the bottom of the painting for example, is copied from the
                mathematician’s graph of the same name, and the f-holes of the cello in the painting describe the
                integral symbol in calculus.
                Similarly, the S curve represents Thom’s second catastrophe graph. Given the often-considerable
                differences in thinking between artist and mathematician (although the lines purportedly blur the more
                theoretical the mathematics becomes) the relationship between Dali and Thom is remarkable.</p>
