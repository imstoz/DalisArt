                            (1935)</strong> is a oil on wood panel painting
                        by Salvador Dalí. It is currently on display at the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg,
                        Florida.</p></a>

            <p>The Archeological Reminiscence Millet's Angelus painting was reproduced countless times in the 19th and
                20th centuries. Salvador was one of the prominent artists who reproduced this print in a study he
                called The Tragic Myth of The Angelus of Millet.

            <p>Salvador also had believed that the two figures were mourning over a buried child. He was so insistent
                on this idea that an X-ray of the canvas was conducted. It almost confirmed his suspicions as the x-ray
                showed a painted-over geometric silhouette that was similar to a coffin. Between the years 1926 and
                1929,
                Salvador made several trips to Paris where he met influential artists like Pablo Picasso who inspired
                him
                to create some pieces of artwork. He also met Joan Miro, the sculptor and Spanish painter, Rene Magritte
                and Paul Elaurd who was a poet. The painters introduced Dali to Surrealism and helped him realise his
                unique themes- sexual symbolism, man's universe and sensations, and ideographic imagery. These themes
                inspired most of Dali’s work, including the Archeological Reminiscence Millet's Angelus painting before
                he changed to other painting influences.</p>
