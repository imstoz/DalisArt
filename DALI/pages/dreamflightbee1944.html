            <p>The work is better known by its shorter title, Flight of a Bee, and was painted while he was living in
                America with Gala, his wife. The image depicts a sleeping woman who is naked, and was modelled on Gala.
                In the image she is somehow flouting within a stunning seascape, and over what is believed to be the
                Mediterranean Sea. Below her, also floating, are two distinctive drops of water, as well as the bee in
                question and the pomegranate, which are also mid air.

            <p>Above the sleeping Gala is the portrayal of her dream, that appears to explode from a pomegranate.
                We see a fish that ejects from his mouth two ferocious tigers, as well as a bayonet. As an observer, it
                is this striking image that alerts us to the fact that the roar of the tigers and the firing of the
                bayonet will eventually rouse her from her troubled slumber.</p>
