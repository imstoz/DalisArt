                        surrealist sculpture in the form of a sofa by Salvador Dalí.
                        The sofa is the centerpiece of an installation at the Dalí Theatre and Museum in Barcelona,
                        Spain.</p></a>

            <p>According to Dali, art should fill all aspects of life. He became interested in furniture after having
                met Jean Michel Franck,
                the famous interior decorator. Around 1934-1935, Dali used a photographic portrait of the actress Mae
                West, to paint a gouache
                picture called: The Face of Mae West which may be used as a surrealistic apartment. The painting
                illustrates his original plan
                for a paranoiac-critical room based on the features of her face. Unfortunately, the project remained
                unexecuted until the opening
                of the Dali Museum in Figueras in 1974. However, during the 1930s Dali did manage to have several sofas
                made according to his design.

            <p>The one illustrated here was commissioned by the important British patron Edward James, whom Dali
                described as the 'humming-bird poet'
                who 'bought the best Dali, and was naturally the richest'. The sofa is the same color as the 'Shocking
                pink' lipstick developed by the
                fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, for whom Dali himself designed hats and dresses in 1937. The sofa's
                shape derives not only from
                Mae West's lips, but also from other sources, including the luxurious curves of Gaudi's architecture.
                With typical perversity, Dali
                took his principal inspiration from a particularly irregular and uncomfortable rocky formation near
                Cadaques. As he himself said,
                Surrealist objects were never meant to be practical.</p>
