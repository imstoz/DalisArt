                        shared by two oil-on-panel
                        paintings created by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí. This painting is displayed at

            <p>The first of these works was painted between 1934 and 1936 and measures 64 cm × 54 cm
                (25 in × 21 in). It depicts a seemingly minimal architectural setting with several surrealist
                images in its finer details. In the distance is a wall housing a bell resembling the figure of
                a woman in bundled skirts. In the distance towards the center is a strangely eroded rock form.
                The most significant element of this image is a small figure in the lower right of a woman running
                with a large hoop. In the shadow cast by the figure, her arms appear to merge into a circle around
                her head. The shadow cast by the figures head takes on the appearance of the hub of a wheel.

            <p>The second work by this title was painted in 1936 and measures 30.5 cm × 33 cm (12.0 in × 13.0 in).
                It depicts a table with three objects set upon it. In the distance beyond the table are six more objects
                in two horizontal rows of three. These objects roughly resemble the three shapes they are aligned with
                on
                the table. This painting is owned by the Salvador Dalí Museum.</p>
