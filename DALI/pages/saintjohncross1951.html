                            (1951)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,

            <p>He was inspired to paint such a magnificent portrait after dreaming of an exact picture of Christ Saint
                John on the cross the previous year. In his dream, he was able to see a combination of different colours
                that he applied in the painting. Salvador Dali decided to portray Christ on the cross from a rare angle
                where he can be viewed from above dangling on the cross. He used oil on canvas to ensure the portrait
                will remain original for a long time.

            <p>On the portrait, Salvador Dali artfully used two realistic different colours that include blue and green
                to portray the amazing scenery of the sea. The painter used a unique technique of painting the sea at an
                eye level while the body of Christ hangs in the air from the cross. Behind the cross, the painter used
                charcoal black oil paint. This was to make the body of Christ to be the centre of attention. He was able
                to portray Christ’s muscles in a fine tone. Aside from that, he was able to paint shadows that created
                depth. In addition, Salvador painted faraway mountains at an eye level. At the bottom of the picture,
                one can see a lone man standing at a dock with his boat. The renowned painter was able to combine
                realistic colours and orderly design to create an impressive surreal portrait of the religious figure.
