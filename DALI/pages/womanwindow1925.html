                        paper realist work by Salvador Dalí,
                        produced in his youth. It shows the painter's sister Ana Maria, seen from behind in front
                        of a window at Cadaqués. It is now in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid</p></a>

            <p>Much of the evidence to help us conclude as to it's location is the small
                reflection in the opened window, which shows the same style of architecture
                that would be found in Cadaques, both then and now. However, it is unknown
                whom the home belonged to, the lady captured is likely to be looking out
                from a holiday home owned by the Dalis, or borrowed for a summer trip from
                other affluent friends.</p>

            <p>What is known about the painting is that the view would have been spectacular
                and of great significance to Dali. It would also appear in other paintings
                from his career, marking it's prominence in his youthful memories.</p>
