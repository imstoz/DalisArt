                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg,
                        Florida and the Dalí Theatre and Museum, Figueres, Spain.</p></a>

            <p>The piece was produced based on Salvador's 1976 paintings, which at a 20m-distance is transformed into
                Abraham Lincoln portrait (Homage to Rothko). Salvador painted 2 original versions of this picture from
                1974 to 1976, which are alike, but they aren't exactly identical. The first one resides in the Figueres,
                Spain-based Dalí Theatre and Museum. The second painting resides in The Salvador Dalí Museum permanent
                collection in St. Petersburg, Florida, in the United States. This painting is typically the basis for
                Salvador's Lincoln in Dalivision lithographic print. This painting resided in Japan before The Salvador
                Dalí Museum acquired it.

            <p>Lincoln in Dalivision is normally referred to as a lithograph or print. But technically, none of these is
                correct because the words have specific meanings whenever we are referring to original artwork created
                in limited editions. It's really a mixed media work of art. Technically, it's a photolith that has
                original etched remarque and embossing.</p>
