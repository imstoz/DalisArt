                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg,

            <p>This painting was executed during a period that the artist called "Nuclear Mysticism”. Typically, Nuclear
                Mysticism is made
                up of different theories trying to explicate the relationships between the conscious mind and quantum
                physics. The different theories are made up of elements ranging from nuclear physics, pop art and
                classicism to Catalan philosophers.

            <p>The name comes from the French phrase nature morte, which translates to "dead nature.” Therefore, by
                adding "Vivante", which means "fast-moving action plus a certain lively quality", Salvador was
                essentially naming the artwork "dead nature in movement". That plays into his Nuclear Mysticism theme,
                which combined elements of science, physics and art.</p>
