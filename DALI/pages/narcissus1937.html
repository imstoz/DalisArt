                        an oil-on-canvas painting by the
                        Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí. Originally titled Métamorphose de Narcisse, this painting is
                        from Dalí's
                        paranoiac-critical period and depicts his interpretation of the Greek myth of Narcissus. Dalí
                        began
                        his painting in the spring of 1937 while in Zürs, in the Austrian Alps This painting is
                        displayed at
                        the Tate Modern, London, UK.</p></a>

            <p>In Dalí's painting, he depicts the figure of Narcissus on the left side of the canvas crouched by a lake,
                with his head resting on his knee, and a stone hand clutching an egg mirroring the shape of his body on
                the
                right. From out of the cracked egg, a narcissus flower sprouts. In the mid-ground of the painting stand
                a
                group of Narcissus's rejected suitors. Among the mountains in the background rests a third Narcissus
                figure.
                Metamorphosis of Narcissus differs from Dalí's other double-image paintings, in which there are multiple
                images
                hidden in one, because Narcissus's figure is doubled in the stone hand.

            <p>On July 19, 1938 in London, Dalí met Sigmund Freud, whom the painter had admired since the 1920s after
                reading
                Freud's book The Interpretation of Dreams. During their meeting, Dalí brought his painting Metamorphosis
                of
                Narcissus in hopes of using it to discuss the psychoanalytic theory of Narcissism and his concept of
                critical
                paranoia, which he developed based on Freud's concept of paranoia. He also was given permission to
                sketch Freud.
                The meeting was arranged by writer Stefan Zweig and Dalí's benefactor, Edward James, who was also in
                attendance
                and ultimately gained ownership of Metamorphosis of Narcissus.</p>
