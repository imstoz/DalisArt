                <p><a href="javascript:javascript:history.go(-1)"><strong>The Madonna of Port Lligat (1950)</strong> is
                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Marquette University, Milwaukee,
                        Wisconsin.</p></a>

        <div class="para1">
            <p>The painting presents the Virgin Mary (posed by Dali’s wife, Gala) and the infant Christ cradling on her
                lap. Both are suspended in the air, have a section carved out of their torso and the Virgin’s arms are
                dismembered. The Child is holding a globe in one hand and a cross in the other and both are joined in
                what seems like a mirror-like reflection, symbolizing the reach of spirituality. Both figures are
                surrounded by Biblical symbols like lemons, urchins, seashells, fish and an egg. The original painting
                has a sea urchin while the 1950 painting has a rhinoceros, a basket of bread and cuttlefish-angels, also
                posed by Gala.

        <div class="para2">
            <p>Also striking in the painting is the use of shapes and colours. Instead of presenting an incoherent
                jumble of images, the piece of art is very clear and symmetrical. The vibrant blue colour scheme of the
                background symbolizes the Catalonia sea which is dear to Dali’s heart. The other marine objects
                highlight the artwork’s Biblical framework as well as the backdrop. Painted after World War II, the
                Madonna of Port Lligat represents some sort of transition for Dali – away from a complete adherence to
                surrealism principles towards a mix of religious and classical aspects. Overall, the painting is a great
                combination of elements that characterize the painter in his surrealist phase and others that reflect
                the religious and classical tradition.</p>
