                        painting by artist Salvador Dal√≠, and one of the
                        most recognizable works of Surrealism. First shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since
                        1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It is
                        widely recognized and frequently referenced in
                        popular culture, and sometimes referred to by more descriptive titles, such as "Melting Clocks",
                        "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".</p></a>

            <p>Melting clocks are the most memorable item in this painting, and the artist was quoted as describing
                them as "...nothing more than the soft, extravagant, solitary, paranoiac-critical Camembert cheese
                of space and time... Hard or soft, what difference does it make! As long as they tell time
                accurately..." To reduce his clocks down to cheese melting in the sun has left many experts on
                the artist unsure as to whether this quote was meant genuinely.</p>

        <div class="para2">
            <p>The scenery found in this painting was directly inspired from Dali's time spent in the Catalonian
                landscape. This region offers an artist some inspirational colours, with vivid reds and oranges.
                Such warmth and brightness is well suited to modern art movements such as Surrealism. Henri Matisse,
                Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh famously found similar in France with their own styles.
                You will again find similar boldness of colour in the background scenes of Elephants and Rose
                Meditative. A
                rtist Dali would always use anything and everything that entered his mind during these periods of
                meditation,
                and would only analyse and select from them afterwards, once the initial canvases had been drafted.</p>
