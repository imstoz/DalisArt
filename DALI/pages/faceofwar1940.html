            <p>The face of war shows the horror and terror people suffer during the war. The snakes surrounding the face
                shows the attack innocent people keep getting even after going through a lot. The technique used in the
                painting if the face of war by Salvador Dali was surrealism. This technique combined the reality of a
                situation with a touch of skill and art. The face of war painting shows the loss, suffering, and misery
                that can be caused by war. The materials used in the The Face of War painting was oil and canvas. Oil
                and canvas are great materials when it comes to paintings since they make each painting stand out. The
                materials show precision in work and show the contrast in colour between the face and the surrounding
                desert.
