                            (1955)</strong> is surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dal√≠. It is currently housed at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.

            <p>The imposing canvas depicts Christ and the twelve apostles perhaps at the moment where he has declared
                "One of you will betray me". While not a historical rendering of the event but rather a depiction of the
                Eucharist itself, the apostles hide their faces whether in shock, disbelief, grief or prayer is hard to
                decide and a large torso with arms outstretched arches over the scene.

        <div class="para2">
            <p>The translucence of the figures of both Christ and the figure above hint at the joining of both God and
                man in the sacrament while the shape of the room suggests an almost space age building hovering by the
                Sea of Galilee with its fishing boats. The banker Chester Hale who was given first refusal of the
                painting bought it on first sight and donated
                it to the National Gallery of Art in Washington the following year where it immediately became the most
                popular work on display. Although not appreciated by the critics who perceived his renewed Catholicism
                as insincere and the art
                which derived from it as lacking the creative genius of his earlier works, or indeed by the gallery who
                relegated it to an out of the way corner, the painting was loved by the American public.</p>
