                            Used As a Table (1934)</strong> is a small Surrealist oil painting
                        by Salvador Dalí. Its full title is The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used as a Table
                        (Phenomenologic
                        Theory of Furniture-Nutrition). It is currently on display at the Salvador Dalí Museum in St.
                        Petersburg, Florida.</p></a>

            <p>It makes reference to The Art of Painting by Johannes Vermeer, a famous
                seventeenth-century work in which a painter, thought to be a self-portrait of Vermeer, is depicted with
                his
                back to us, in distinctive costume. It is one of a number of paintings expressive of Dalí's enormous
                admiration for Vermeer.

        <div class="para2">
            <p>Vermeer is represented as a dark spindly figure in a kneeling position. The figure's outstretched leg
                serves as a table top surface, on which sits a bottle and a small glass. This leg tapers to a
                baluster-like
                stub; there is a shoe nearby. The walls and the distant views of the mountains are based on real views
                near
                Dalí's home in Port Lligat. In Vermeer's painting the artist leans on a maulstick, and his hand is
                painted
                with an unusual blurriness, perhaps to indicate movement. In Dalí's painting Vermeer rests the same arm
                on a crutch.</p>
