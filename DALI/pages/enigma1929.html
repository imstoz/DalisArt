                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. The painting is currently on display at the Gallery of
                        Modern Art in Munich.</p></a>

            <p>Almost half of the eighty one compartments pressed into the central shape contain the words
                ma mère ("my mother". The other half, farthest from the head, seem to still be waiting for words
                to be etched into them. On the left, above Dali's sleeping head is one of his characteristic
                strange amalgam shapes. It possesses the head of a woman, a lion, a locust (ever present in many of
                Dali's
                drawings) and a young man. The young man's form also has arms encircling the egg-shaped head of another
                older man who, in turn, reaches around to stab the form in the back with a knife. On two sides of what
                would be the geometrical center of the frame, two large apertures can be seen in the dominant shape of
                the painting.</p>

            <p>Through the left hole, a distant rock structure is set in stark color contrasts with the white and brown
                sky and land. The structure features the torso of a woman. On the extreme top-right, a smaller
                protrusion
                comes out of the larger shape, seemingly resembling the head of an animal. The base of the large
                structure
                is shaped like the curved forms of fin de siècle architecture and furniture, with intricate and elegant
                designs encrusted throughout. The base also has molluscs, which strengthens the allusions to Cape Creus.
