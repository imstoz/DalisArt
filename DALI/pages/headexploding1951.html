                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dal√≠. It is currently housed at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art,
                        Edinburgh, U.K.</p></a>

            <p>The brush strokes are bright, simple and expressive. This mystical composition very skilfully merges
                layers of disparate themes into a fascinating whole. The 1945 detonations of two atomic bombs over the
                Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki deeply affected Dali. An explosion pervades this artwork. He
                created several other works with fragmented figures and heads (common motifs among post-war artists),
                reflecting the shattering physical and psychological trauma associated with nuclear weapons. The heavy
                brown clouds in the upper area are dark and menacing.

            <p>The delicate halo of the Madonna, very obviously Raphaelesque with her tilted visage, can also be
                interpreted as a mushroom cloud. The juxtaposition of the divine, exquisite and serene face of the
                Virgin Mary very meaningfully suggests the conflicts between war and peace, beauty and destruction and
                of certainty and uncertainty. Her expression is sad and contemplative as if in silent prayer for the
                sake of mankind. The fluid atomic particles are represented by strange rhinoceros horns (a peculiar
                leitmotif of Dali's work) arranged in circles creating a dynamic vortex. Tears running down the mother's
                face are also suggested. However, through the oculus, beams a wide shaft of warm heavenly light imbuing
                the scene with spiritual inspiration.</p>
