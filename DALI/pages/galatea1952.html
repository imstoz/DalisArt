                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Dalí Theatre and Museum, Figueres, Spain.

            <p>Dali was fascinated by nuclear physics and when the atom bomb was first dropped he felt it had to be
                incorporated into art. Dali was probably amongst the first group of artists to depict the nuclear age
                with his image "Idillio Atomico" in 1945. He described the atom as his favourite food for thought.

            <p>Galatea of the Spheres is a wonderful piece. Suspended spheres, depicting the atomic particles, orbit
                around and also create the face of "Galatea" who is a sea nymph in classical mythology. Her eyes are
                closed and the viewer is drawn to her mouth where the spheres appear to originate.</p>
