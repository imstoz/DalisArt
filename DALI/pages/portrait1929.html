                        surrealist oil painting on
                        canvas by Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It is currently housed at the Gala
                        and Salvador Dali Foundation, Figueras.</p></a>

            <p>Paul Éluard was a famous French poet and a founding member of the Surrealist movement.
                He was also married to Gala Dali for 12 years, prior to her relationship with Salvador.
                On initial inspection, we immediately see the standard layout used by Dali at this time.
                There are the bright landscape colours which we likely inspired by his upbringing in
                Catalonia. There is then the focal point of the composition, Paul Éluard himself who is
                floating mid-air in the centre of the artwork. Additionally, there are then the true surrealist
                touches, inspired by the artist's dreams and ideas which can confuse and excite us in equal
                measure. Therefore, we must examine the items that sit alongside the portrait and try to
                decipher their identity as well as the reason behind each one's inclusion.</p>

        <div class="para2">
            <p>The artwork was completed in 1929, which was a very significant year for Dali, both artistically
                but also within his own personal life. <em><a href="/thegreat1929.html">The Great Masturbator</a></em>,
                one of his finest paintings, appeared
                this year for example. These two paintings bear similarities in that they tell of Dali's own sexual
                frustrations, so do not be distracted by the fact that it is actually Eluard who is pictured here.
                Eluard and his wife had visited Dalí at Cadaqués in the summer of that year and Salvador was immediately
                smitten with Gala. They would eventually hold a loving relationship for some fifty years, but initially
                he would be frustrated because of her existing marriage to the poet. Dali was not someone to let
                something
                like this get in his way and did eventually prevail.</p>
