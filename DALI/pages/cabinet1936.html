            <p>Dali's work on The Anthropomorphic Cabinet was a largely influenced by Sigmund Freuds work that explains
                that
                the human body is made up of secret drawers that can only be told by the study of the unconscious mind.
                This
                interpretation by Sigmund Freud was after he had read a novel that explained study of unconscious mind.
                The
                study explained that the small cabinets are combined to form body parts. The painting was done in the
                year
                1936. He used a pencil to make a first sketch on a white coloured wood then he did the final painting in
                ink.
                In 1979, Dali decided to make a sculpture of the painting. The Anthropomorphic Cabinet in size was 60 by
                30
                centimetres and was made of bronze with a dark thin layer of patina formed on it due to its age. Dali
                was
                assisted by Marcel Duchamp to modify a plaster cast of the Venus de Milo; an ancient Greek statue done
                by
                Alexandros of Antioch to form the Anthropomorphic cabinet.

            <p>The cabinet Dali formed is a female figure that is seated down with the drawers covered with fur. Her
                head leans
                forward and the hair falls downwards covering the face. The hand is stretched out to depict rejecting
                and some of
                her drawers are partially pulled out. The drawers that are open have their keys placed inside. The upper
                part of
                her body that consists of the chest is full of darkness and only the drawer handles that indicate her
                nipples can
                be seen. Dali was a great admirer of Sigmund Freud who was a psychoanalysis doctor and praised him by
                saying that
                the only difference between old people and new era is Sigmund Freud who discovered that the human body
                is full of
                secret drawers only to be opened by psychoanalysis. The drawers to him resembled the subconscious mind
                that is within.
                In the 17th century the Italian mannerist called Bracelli was known to use the furniture figures. The
                familiarity of
                their use by Dali also influenced use of drawers in his figures especially the Anthropomorphic Cabinet.
